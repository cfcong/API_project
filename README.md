## Lighthouse Labs Week 2 Day 3 Assignment [jQuery,AJAX,JSON]

This application fetches data from an external service using AJAX with jQuery. In this particular project, I did a weather application that uses Weather Underground's JSON API. With the form input, you can type partial of cities names, and the API will list cities with that partial name. Upon clicking each city, you are able to see the weather for the current day and up to 3 day forecast.
